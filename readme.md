In this project I will atempt to:

1. Do exploratory data analysis.
2. Create a word-level NLP data preprocessing pipeline.
3. Build a (bidirectional) recurrent deep learning model.
4. Build a 1d convolutional deep learning model.
5. Build a hybrid (recurrent + convolutional) deep learning model.
6. Compare the performance of the different deep learning models.

### TODO

- Implement plaing model without Glove embeddings
- Try data balancing on train dataset
